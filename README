Since simple save is no longer available, I was looking for a nice simple way to back up my server maps with minimal configuration. Just set the folder and the interval, and your away. Most of the plugins I found had too many features for such a simple task (in my own opinion) so I decided to create this little plugin. Basing my code of Banana Backup I began coding and threw this together.

I am planning to change the way the plugin works to make it different in features form bananabackup. for the moment all that's different is the structure of the code and the way it saves the zip files, I also added in some more configuration options (and removed some as well)

What can I use this for?

Simple Backup is a plugin to zip up your minecraft server worlds to a folder so you can:

Let your users download them
Roll back your map
Plus more features as development goes on, but not too many because this is a simple plugin remember.

Configuring:

Configuring SimpleBackup is easy, just open the "config.yml" file and modify the settings in there, here's an example with some comments:

#Interval between map saves in hours, 0.25 is 15 minutes, 1.0 is 1 hour and so on. (1 hour is default).
backup-interval-hours: 1.0

#Message tag shown in the chat when the server is backing up.
backup-message: '[SimpleBackup]'

#Worlds to back up, add more on a new line like so: - WORLD_NAME_HERE
backup-worlds:
- world
- world_nether
- world_the_end

#Date format of the filename, it is set for "YEAR-MONTH-DAY-HOUR-MINUTE-SECOND".
backup-date-format: yyyy-MM-DD-hh-mm-ss

#Interval between different world saves, It will wait X milliseconds before zipping the next world (If more than one world is specified).
interval-between: 100

#The backup folder used by the plugin, defaults to the server.jar location.
backup-file: backups/

#Choose to broadcast the backup message in the chat.
broadcast-message: true
